    <p><b><u><i>In the early <span style="font-size:2.6em;century;color:cyan;">medieval</span> era, Christianity, Islam,
                    Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became <br> established on India's southern and western coasts.[43]
                    Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[44] <br> eventually
                    founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval
                    Islam.[45] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu
                    culture in south India.[46] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised
                    religion.[47] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48] leaving a
                    legacy of luminous architecture.[h][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company
                    followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British
                    Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but
                    technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took
                    root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent
                    resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian
                    Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of
                    India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented
                    migration.[60]</i></u></b></p>
